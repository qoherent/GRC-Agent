# QT GUI Range
This block creates a variable with a choice of widgets. The variable can be given a default value and its value can be changed at runtime within a specified range.

The ID will be the variable name, so that ID can be used as a parameter in another block to make it adjustable in real-time.

Leave the label blank to use the variable id as the label.

This block does not support C++ output, so it cannot be used when the output language of a flowgraph in GRC is C++.
